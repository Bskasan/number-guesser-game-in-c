/*
Create a program called number guesser - Create your main method in C.
Try to create creative UI on the Command Prompt...
There will be secret number that si set at the start of the program without any user number.
	Find a way to create random number in C programming when you run the program.
	** IDEA ** -> You can generate power up numbers to get player more rights to guess.
	** IDEA ** -> You can try to animate your text when game starts.
The secret number should be picked from a certain range.
The range of the number should be output to the player.
The player should be prompted to enter his guess.
The prompt should show how many guesses the player has left.
The player will then enter his guess.
If the guess is too high then the game will output that the guess was too high.
If the guess is too low then the game will output that it was too low.
The player only has a certain number of guesses, but it can change.
The number of guesses should be based on the range of the secret number.
Any wrong guess will decrement the number of guesses left.
The game ends by saying what the secret number was regardless of if the player guessed the right number.
When the game is over, the player should be prompted if he would like to play again.
If yes, then the secret number should change.
Any input errors by the player should have proper handling.
Create level system, start with 1-5, 1-10, 1-20, 1-30, 1-40, 1-50, 1-100 (Final boss)
Try to add timer, and show this timer when player is succeed or failed.
